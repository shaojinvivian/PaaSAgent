 * response from it.  This class extends the HttpServletResponseWrapper
 * (which implements HttpServletResponse and ServletResponse) and 
 * overloads the three methods that can set the status code.  All three
 * overloaded methods save the status code in a private field, so that we
 * can return that value when it is required.  This feature is required
